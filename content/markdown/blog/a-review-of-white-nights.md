## Context

For the last long while, I have been on and off reading Crime and Punishment
by Fyodor Dostoevsky. While I have been thoroughly enjoying the writing
style and the story itself, I have struggled to read such a large novel 
consistently during the school term. 

Recently, I was away for the holiday's with my partner's family where we did a
secret santa gift exchange, which is how I received a copy of White Nights 
(and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, but more on that in another post!). 
So first of all, a big thanks to my partner's sister for the book, and to *her* 
partner for recommending it!

White Nights was a lovely start-to-finish introduction to Dostoevsky's work for 
me, since it is a concise yet impactful story which follows just a few characters. 

## Solitude

### The Passerby

White Nights begins by describing the unnamed protagonist's (who we will call 
"The Dreamer") life of acute solitude through the illustration of his late-night
walks in St. Petersburg. The Dreamer's closest resemblance to a friendship is 
found in passing encounters with an older man whom he *believes* takes an 
interest in his presence.

I felt that this was a very effective way of describing The Dreamer's extent of 
solitude, as I too have had habitual "pass-by people" who I believe take an 
interest in my presence, as I do their's, but have never experienced them being 
my "closest friend".

### Talking Houses

The Dreamer then introduces us to his deep sense of acquaintenceship with the 
city, and especially the houses. The Dreamer claims to "know the homes 
intimately" which of course contain the people he wish would speak with him. 
He relies on his imagination to create personifications of these houses'
personalities based on their appearances and states, which lead to fabricated 
conversations between him and his favourite houses, mostly pertaining to their 
wellbeing.

This section of the first white night really deepened my understanding of just 
how far The Dreamer's solitude is. I started to shift from mostly just feeling 
empathy for our protagonist in his longing for a friend, to primarily feeling 
an eerie sense of concern for his sanity and perception of reality.
