Hola! My name is Diego and welcome to my little spot on the internet.

This is my personal website where I post about things I'm building, learning, 
or really anything I am interested in.

## About This Site

This site is generated using my very own Rust-based static site generator!

All content is written in markdown, and all the aesthetics are configured in a 
TOML file, then it is automatically converted into HTML and CSS.

## Why a Static Site Generator

I did it this way to prioritize simplicity in website editing, so that I can 
very quickly create new blog posts and very easily change the aesthetics when I 
inevitably start using a new colour theme for my text-editor, and decide to make
my website look like it (currently Gruvbox lol).

Also I have had an itch to learn Rust for a long time and I figured this would 
be a fun way to gain some fluency in the language.
