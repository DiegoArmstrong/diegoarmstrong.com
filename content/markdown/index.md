Hola! My name is Diego and welcome to my little spot on the internet.

This is my personal website where I post about things I'm building, learning, or really anything I am interested in.

## About This Site

This site is generated using my own Rust-based static site generator.  
All content is written in Markdown and a .toml config then turned into HTML and CSS automatically.
