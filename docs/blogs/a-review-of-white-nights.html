<h1>“White Nights” by Fyodor Dostoevsky</h1>
<img src="/pictures/white-nights.webp" alt="white-nights" width="180" style="border-radius:12px; margin-right:12px;" />
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>For the last long while, I have been on and off reading Crime and Punishment
by Fyodor Dostoevsky. While I have been thoroughly enjoying the writing
style and the story itself, I have struggled to read such a large novel
consistently during the school term.</p>
<p>Recently, I was away for the holiday’s with my partner’s family where we did a
secret santa gift exchange, which is how I received a copy of White Nights
(and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, but more on that in another post!).
So first of all, a big thanks to my partner’s sister for the book, and to <em>her</em>
partner for recommending it!</p>
<p>White Nights was a lovely start-to-finish introduction to Dostoevsky’s work for
me, since it is a concise yet impactful story which follows just a few characters.</p>
<h2>Solitude</h2>
<h3>The Passerby</h3>
<p>White Nights begins by describing the unnamed protagonist’s (who we will call
“The Dreamer”) life of acute solitude through the illustration of his late-night
walks in St. Petersburg. The Dreamer’s closest resemblance to a friendship is
found in passing encounters with an older man whom he <em>believes</em> takes an
interest in his presence.</p>
<p>I felt that this was a very effective way of describing The Dreamer’s extent of
solitude, as I too have had habitual “pass-by people” who I believe take an
interest in my presence, as I do their’s, but have never experienced them being
my “closest friend”.</p>
<h3>Talking Houses</h3>
<p>The Dreamer then introduces us to his deep sense of acquaintenceship with the
city, and especially the houses. The Dreamer claims to “know the homes
intimately” which of course contain the people he wish would speak with him.
He relies on his imagination to create personifications of these houses’
personalities based on their appearances and states, which lead to fabricated
conversations between him and his favourite houses, mostly pertaining to their
wellbeing.</p>
<p>This section of the first white night really deepened my understanding of just
how far The Dreamer’s solitude is. I started to shift from mostly just feeling
empathy for our protagonist in his longing for a friend, to primarily feeling
an eerie sense of concern for his sanity and perception of reality.</p>
