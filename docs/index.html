<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Hola! My name is Diego and welcome to my little spot on the internet.</p>
<p>This is my personal website where I post about things I’m building, learning,
or really anything I am interested in.</p>
<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>This site is generated using my very own Rust-based static site generator!</p>
<p>All content is written in markdown, and all the aesthetics are configured in a
TOML file, then it is automatically converted into HTML and CSS.</p>
<h3>Why a Static Site Generator</h3>
<p>I did it this way to prioritize simplicity in website editing, so that I can
very quickly create new blog posts and very easily change the aesthetics.</p>
<p>Also I have had an itch to learn Rust for a long time and I figured this would
be a fun way to gain some fluency in the language.</p>
